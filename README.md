# Rainfall-prediction
Rainfall prediction using different models </br>
**Overview**</br>
This Jupyter notebook analyzes rainfall data using various Python data science libraries and machine learning techniques. The notebook follows a typical data science workflow: loading data, cleaning, exploration/visualization, and prepares for modeling.</br>

**Key Components**
1. Data Loading</br>
Loads a CSV file named "Rainfall.csv" containing weather data with columns like:
day, pressure, maxtemp, temperature, mintemp, dewpoint, humidity, cloud, rainfall, sunshine, winddirection, windspeed
</br>
2. Data Cleaning</br>
Handles missing values in 'winddirection' and 'windspeed' columns</br>
Renames a column with extra whitespace (' winddirection' â†’ 'winddirection')</br>
Converts categorical 'rainfall' column (yes/no) to binary (1/0)</br>
3. Data Exploration</br>
Basic statistics using describe()</br>
Shape checking (366 entries, 12 columns)</br>
Initial visualizations setup (though no plots are shown in the visible code)</br>

4. Machine Learning Preparation</br>
Imports various scikit-learn models:</br>

RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, SVM, KNN, GaussianNB</br>

Feature selection methods (PCA, RFE)</br>

**Preprocessing tools**

Notable Observations</br>
Data Quality Issues:</br>

Column names had inconsistent whitespace</br>

Missing values in winddirection (1) and windspeed (1)</br>

Rainfall was categorical (yes/no) needing conversion</br>

**Feature Engineering:**

The 'rainfall' column is clearly the target variable for binary classification</br>

Other columns appear to be weather measurements that could predict rainfall</br>

**Visualization Setup:**</br>

Seaborn's whitegrid style is initialized</br>

Several visualization steps are prepared but not shown in the visible portion</br>

**Machine Learning Readiness:**</br>

The notebook imports many scikit-learn classifiers, suggesting the author plans to compare different models</br>

Feature selection methods are imported, indicating interest in dimensionality reduction</br>

**Suggested Next Steps**</br>
Complete the Visualization:</br>

Add actual plotting code to explore relationships between variables and rainfall</br>

Model Implementation:</br>

Split data into train/test sets</br>

Implement and compare the imported classifiers</br>

Evaluate feature importance</br>

Feature Engineering:</br>

Consider creating derived features (e.g., temp ranges, humidity changes)</br>

Normalize/scale numerical features if needed</br>

Time Series Analysis:</br>

Since data includes 'day' column, could explore temporal patterns</br>
</br>
The notebook shows a solid foundation for a rainfall prediction project but appears incomplete as it stops before implementing models or showing visualizations. The data cleaning and preparation steps are thorough and well-documented.
